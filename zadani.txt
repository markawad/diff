Extended diff-tool

Create a program similar to UNIX diff command. Implement the following features:

tool adjusts its output based on given input file types
output type can be set explicitly (e.g. HTML file can be compared in a binary mode)
supports at least 3 different file types
tool is able to compare entire directories (both files and directories content)
supports at least 2 arguments for at least 1 file type (e.g. what is to be ignored, allows to define equivalent expressions)
File types examples:

binary file - compares bytes
text file - compares textual representation, ignores whitespaces, does not ignore paragraphs
HTML - ignores attributes order
JSON - ignores data order
C source file - attempts to map variable and function names (e.g. based on the order of their calls, definitions)
picture - the result could be a picture with average of both
Optional: the tool can compare two different file types on the meaning level: HTML vs. Markdown, directory vs. compressed archive

Where polymorphism is to be used? (recommended)

Different kinds of output: textual (every difference on a single line), differences recorded in a file, new file with marked differences
File types: binary, textual, Markdown, HTML, JSON, XML, source code etc.
Comparison parameters: ignoring whitespaces, equivalent expressions, ignoring base URL in links
